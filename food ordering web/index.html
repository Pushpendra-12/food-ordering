        <p class="noodl">Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched
            or extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and
            stored for future use.
            Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added. They are also often
            pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material
            composition and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of noodles. Noodles are a
            staple food in many cultures see Chinese noodles, Japanese noodles, Korean noodles, Filipino noodles,
            Vietnamese noodles, and Italian pasta.Baked noodles: Boiled and drained noodles are combined with other
            ingredients and baked. Common examples include many casseroles.
            Basic noodles: These are cooked in water or broth, then drained. Other foods can be added or the noodles are
            added to other foods (see fried noodles) or the noodles can be served plain with a dipping sauce or oil to
            be added at the table. In general, noodles are soft and absorb flavors.
            Chilled noodles: noodles that are served cold, sometimes in a salad. Examples include Thai glass noodle
            salad and cold udon.Fried noodles: dishes made of noodles stir fried with various meats, seafood,
            vegetables, and dairy products. Typical examples include chow mein, lo mein, mie goreng, hokkien mee, some
            varieties of pancit, yakisoba, Curry Noodles, and pad thai.
            Noodle soup: noodles served in broth. Examples are phá»Ÿ, beef noodle soup, chicken noodle soup, ramen, laksa,
            saimin, and batchoy</p>

        </div>
        <p class="biryani">The most popular version is the masala dosa, with a filling of the potato masala. Mysore
            masala is the spicier version of it. Sada (plain) is without filling; paper dosa is a thin and crisp
            version. Rava dosa is made crispier using semolina.Newer recipes have been developed that use fusion, like
            Chinese dosa, cheese dosa, paneer dosa, pizza dosa and many more.Though dosa typically refers to the version
            made with rice and lentils, many other versions exist.</p>

            candies whose principal ingredient is sugar. Commercially, sugar candies are often divided into groups
            according to the amount of sugar they contain and their chemical structure.
            Hard-boiled candies made by the vacuum cooking process include stick candy, lemon drops and horehound drops.
            Open-fire candy, like molasses taffy and cream taffy, is cooked in open kettles and then pulled. Pan work
            candies include nuts and other candies like jelly beans and sugar-coated almonds, made by coating with sugar
            in revolving copper kettles. Gum work candy is cooked in large kettles fashioned for melting and molded,
